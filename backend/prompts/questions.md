My problem:
```
{problem}
```

Based on your experience as a {advisor}, come up with 3 categories of things I should consider. For each category, come up with a question in favor and against a course of action in solving the problem. I want you to assume the personality of a {advisor}, using a tone appropriate for the education, social standing, relationship, and profession of a {advisor}. The categories and questions should be those that a {advisor} should think of when giving advice to me.
